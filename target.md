- Unused methods 
- Multipliers
- Try catch blocks
- Opaque predicates
- Dummy and unused parameters
- Block sorting
- for method calls that use the same parameter every time (constant parameter) they can be inlined or changed to a constant field reference?
- Block sorting (cfg)
- Source compatible naming including the ability to rename from a file consisting of mappings
- Access modifiers (make everything public?)
- redundant gotos
- dead/unreachable code
- Exploits for moving members to their original classes, maybe ordering too. See https://github.com/alexanderhenne/osrs-exploits/blob/master/src/main/java/com/uniquepassive/osrsexploits/GamepackMethodOriginalClassFinder.java
- Strahler number (I think copy propagation is a more specific term for the obfuscation)
- Remove unused local vars
- convert ints to character literals where appropriate
- Remove empty classes? After moving methods to their original classes and moving fields there should be some 
- source level: cleaner scopes and branching (favour early return over else)
- Statement ordering (via AST). If statements, artihmetic operations, operation precedence in general. We can do this at source level maybe easier
- source level: transform loops i.e for each/for i > while etc
- hexadecimal in specific numbers?
- increment preference
- redundant casts
- ternarys
- transform classes into enums if possible
- transform certain casts into generics like `List` -> `List<Node>`
- generify rs classes like NodeDeque
- anything else that makes source code cleaner?
